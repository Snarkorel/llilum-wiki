#Next steps 

We will make additions to the system on a monthly basis, and we will implement major user facing features on a quarterly cadence. 

Major work items for next quarter (July 2015 to end of August 2015) are: 

1. Implement Ref counted GC and one flavor of tracking GC 
2. Define ABI for portability on [CMSIS](http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php) and [ARM Mbed](http://mbed.org/) 
3. Implement Threading support 
4. Add more interop support for targeting ABI layer

Full exception handling support will come in in following quarter.
